This task can be accomplished without introducing infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters using a least favorable entropy-maximizing distribution.We demonstrate, through examples and simulations, that this approach covers a wide class of latent variables models, including some game- theoretic models and models with limited dependent variables, interval-valued data, errors-in-variables, or combinations thereof. Both point- and set-identified models are transparently covered. In the latter case, the method also complements the recent lit- erature on generic set-inference methods by providing the moment conditions needed to construct a generalized method of moments-type objective function for a wide class of models. Extensions of the method that cover conditional moments, independence restrictions, and some state-space models are also given.",

		"abstract": "This paper studies the implications of tax evasion for the optimal design of central bank digital currency (CBDC). I build a general equilibrium framework to explicitly allow tax evasion by agents and tax audits by a government. I find that as long as CBDC offers less anonymity than cash, introducing CBDC will decrease tax evasion. However, if CBDC is \"cash-like\" in the sense that it still offers relatively high level of anonymity but low interest rate, then introducing CBDC will decrease the output from not only agents who evade taxes but also agents who report their income truthfully. If CBDC is instead \"deposit-like\" in the sense that it offers low anonymity but high interest rate, then introducing CBDC will increase output and aggregate welfare. Furthermore, introducing deposit-like CBDC needs not increase the funding costs of private banks or decrease bank lending and investment. However, paying a high interest rate on CBDC will decrease the central bank's net interest revenue, which may jeopardize the central bank's independence.",

		"abstract": "Economic models often depend on quantities that are unobservable, either for privacy reasons or because they are difficult to measure. Examples of such variables include human capital (or ability), personal income, unobserved het-erogeneity (such as consumer \"types\"), etc. This situation has historically been handled either by simply using observable imperfect proxies for each the unob-servables, or by assuming that such unobservables satisfy convenient conditional mean or independence assumptions that enable their elimination from the estimation problem. However, thanks to tremendous increases in both the amount of data available and computing power, it has become possible to take full advantage of recent formal methods to infer the statistical properties of unobservable variables from multiple imperfect measurements of them. The general framework used is the concept of measurement systems in which a vector of observed variables is expressed as a (possibly nonlinear or nonparamet-ric) function of a vector of all unobserved variables (including unobserved error terms or \"disturbances\" that may have non additively separable affects). The framework emphasizes important connections with related fields, such as non-linear panel data, limited dependent variables, game theoretic models, dynamic models and set-identification. This review reports the progress made towards the central question of whether there exist plausible assumptions under which one can identify the joint distribution of the unobservables from the knowledge of the joint distribution of the observables. It also overviews empirical efforts aimed at exploiting such identification results to deliver novel findings that formally account for the unavoidable presence of unobservables.",

		"abstract": "Using a Cournot oligopoly model with an endogenous number of firms and evasion of indirect taxes, we show that more intense competition may have the negative side effect of increasing tax evasion, thereby, lowering public revenues and welfare. This will be the case if market entry costs decrease. A similar result will hold if marginal production costs fall and demand is either weakly concave, or convex and inelastic. The result of more competition, less evasion and higher public revenues will be obtained if (a) marginal production costs fall and demand is convex and elastic or (b) the demand elasticity increases. As a policy implication, we prove that tax enforcement should be intensified if there is a negative trade-off between competition and evasion.",

This result is based on the assumption that the audit probability and the penalty rate are fixed or depend on the understatement or overstatement of relevant economic indicators. However, under alternative and perhaps more reasonable formulations of the audit probability, the neutrality of profit taxes may not be preserved. In particular, if the audit probability or the penalty rate varies with some reports made by the monopo-list (such as reported cost or reported revenue or output level), then profit taxes are no longer neutral.",

		"abstract": "Mexico has kept electronic records of all taxable transactions since 2014. Anonymized data collected by the Mexican federal government comprises more than 80 million contributors (individuals and companies) and almost 7 billion monthly-aggregations of invoices among contributors between January 2015 and December 2018. This data includes a list of almost ten thousand contributors already identified as tax evaders, due to their activities fabricating invoices for non-existing products or services so that recipients can evade taxes. Harnessing this extensive dataset, we build monthly and yearly temporal networks where nodes are contributors and directed links are invoices produced in a given time slice. Exploring the properties of the network neighborhoods around tax evaders, we show that their interaction patterns differ from those of the majority of contributors. In particular, invoicing loops between tax evaders and their clients are over-represented. With this insight, we use two machine-learning methods to classify other contributors as suspects of tax evasion: deep neural networks and random forests. We train each method with a portion of the tax evader list and test it with the rest, obtaining more than 0.9 accuracy with both methods. By using the complete dataset of contributors, each method classifies more than 100 thousand suspects of tax evasion, with more than 40 thousand suspects classified by both methods. We further reduce the number of suspects by focusing on those with a short network distance from known tax evaders. We thus obtain a list of highly suspicious contributors sorted by the amount of evaded tax, valuable information for the authorities to further investigate illegal tax activity in Mexico. With our methods, we estimate previously undetected tax evasion in the order of \\$10 billion USD per year by about 10 thousand contributors.",

Using recently developed results in conjunction with reasonable assumptions about the exogeneity of the lights data generating process, we identify and estimate the relationship between nighttime light growth and GDP growth, as well as the nonparametric distribution of errors in both measures. We obtain three key results: (i) the elasticity of nighttime lights to GDP is about 1.3; (ii) national accounts GDP growth measures are less precise for low and middle income countries, and nighttime lights can play a big role in improving such measures; and (iii) our new measure of GDP growth, based on the optimal combination of nighttime lights and national accounts data under our identification assumptions, implies that China and India had considerably lower growth rates than official data suggested between 1993 and 2013. We expect our statistical framework and methodology to have a broad impact on measuring GDP using additional information.",

		"abstract": "While the literature on nonclassical measurement error traditionally relies on the availability of an auxiliary data set containing correctly measured observations, we establish that the availability of instruments enables the identification of a large class of nonclassical nonlinear errors-in-variables models with continuously distributed variables. Our main identifying assumption is that, conditional on the value of the true regressors, some \"measure of location\" of the distribution of the measurement error (e.g., its mean, mode, or median) is equal to zero. The proposed approach relies on the eigenvalue-eigenfunction decomposition of an integral operator associated with specific joint probability densities. The main identifying assumption is used to \"index\" the eigenfunctions so that the decomposition is unique. We propose a convenient sieve-based estimator, derive its asymptotic properties, and investigate its finite-sample behavior through Monte Carlo simulations.",

This finding has shaped research agendas in a number of fields, including (but not limited to) macroeconomics, industrial organization, labor, and trade. This paper surveys and evaluates recent empirical work addressing the question of why businesses differ in their measured productivity levels. The causes are manifold, and differ depending on the particular setting. They include elements sourced in production practices-and therefore over which producers have some direct control, at least in theory-as well as from producers' external operating environments.

		"abstract": "Estimates for the U.S. suggest that at least in some sectors productivity enhancing reallocation is the dominant factor in accounting for productivity growth. An open question, particularly relevant for developing countries, is whether reallocation is always productivity enhancing. It may be that imperfect competition or other barriers to competitive environments imply that the reallocation process is not fully efficient in these countries. Using a unique plant-level longitudinal dataset for Colombia for the period 1982-1998, we explore these issues by examining the interaction between market allocation, and productivity and profitability. Moreover, given the important trade, labor and financial market reforms in Colombia during the early 1990s, we explore whether and how the contribution of reallocation changed over the period of study. Our data permit measurement of plant-level quantities and prices. Taking advantage of the rich structure of our price data, we propose a sequential methodology to estimate productivity and demand shocks at the plant level. First, we estimate total factor productivity (TFP) with plant-level physical output data, where we use downstream demand to instrument inputs. We then turn to estimating demand shocks and mark-ups with plant-level price data, using TFP to instrument for output in the inverse-demand equation. We examine the evolution of the distributions of TFP and demand shocks in response to the market reforms in the 1990s. We find that market reforms are associated with rising overall productivity that is largely driven by reallocation away from low- and towards high-productivity businesses. In addition, we find that the allocation of activity across businesses is less driven by demand factors after reforms. We find that the increase in aggregate productivity post-reform is entirely accounted for by the improved allocation of activity. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

We show that multinational firms are able to shift profits abroad even if they fully comply with the tax code. This is because, in equilibrium, intra-firm transactions occur in firms that are better than the market at input production. Moreover, market input prices include a mark-up that arises from the bargaining between the firm and the independent supplier. Transfer prices set at market values following the arm's length principle thus systematically exceed multinationals' marginal costs, leading to a reduction of tax payments for each unit sold. The optimal organization of firms hence provides a new rationale for the empirically observed lower tax burden of multinational corporations. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

		"abstract": "This paper reviews the recent developments in nonparametric identification of measurement error models and their applications in applied microeconomics, in particular, in empirical industrial organization and labor economics. Measurement error models describe mappings from a latent distribution to an observed distribution. The identification and estimation of measurement error models focus on how to obtain the latent distribution and the measurement error distribution from the observed distribution. Such a framework is suitable for many microeconomic models with latent variables, such as models with unobserved heterogeneity or unobserved state variables and panel data models with fixed effects. Recent developments in measurement error models allow very flexible specification of the latent distribution and the measurement error distribution. These developments greatly broaden economic applications of measurement error models. This paper provides an accessible introduction of these technical results to empirical researchers so as to expand applications of measurement error models.",

Using recently developed results in conjunction with reasonable assumptions about the exogeneity of the lights data generating process, we identify and estimate the relationship between nighttime light growth and GDP growth, as well as the non-parametric distribution of errors in both measures. We obtain three key results: (i) the elasticity of nighttime lights to GDP is about 1.3; (ii) national accounts GDP growth measures are less precise for low and middle income countries, and nighttime lights can play a big role in improving such measures; and (iii) our new measure of GDP growth, based on the optimal combination of nighttime lights and national accounts data under our identification assumptions, implies that China and India had considerably lower growth rates than official data suggested between 1993 and 2013. We expect our statistical framework and methodology to have a broad impact on measuring GDP using additional information.",

We use lagged investment to instrument for potentially mis-measured capital stock, while conditioning on the part of productivity that is persistent. Our estimation routine nests standard approaches in the literature, such as Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015). It requires no additional data as investment is usually collected with other producer level data. We show through Monte-Carlo experiments that a 40 percent measurement error in capital yields capital coefficients that are biased downward by a factor of two. We illustrate our approach using data for three distinct economies: China, India and Chile; which experienced radically different processes of capital and productivity dynamics. We find capital coefficients that are typically two times larger than those using standard approaches that only control for simultaneity.",

		"abstract": "The paper shows a key role of human capital in explaining how US postwar growth and welfare could have increased while tax rates declined. As in evidence, we assume that the share of government revenue in output has remained stable and model tax evasion within an endogenous growth model with human capital. A trend upwards in the productivity of the goods or human capital sectors gradually decreases the degree of tax evasion, and causes a trend upwards in time spent in human capital accumulation. These productivity increases also increase the ratio of tax revenue to GDP at any given tax rate such that the tax rate must be reduced in order to be consistent with the stylized fact of a constant share of government revenue in output. Based on estimated US postwar goods and human capital sectoral productivities, the model explains 30% of the actual decline in a weighted average of postwar US top marginal personal and corporate tax rates. The estimated joint sectoral productivity increases are asymmetric with a larger relative increase in the human capital investment sector, a result related to McGrattan and Prescott's (2010) relatively larger increase in the productivity of the sector producing intangible capital relative to the goods sector. We show that in a special case of exogenous growth without human capital investment, the explanatory power of the tax trend drops signi…cantly. JEL Classi…cation: E13, E62, H26, O41",

Abstract There is a sizeable overall tax gap in the U.S., albeit tax noncompliance differs sharply across income types. While only small percentages of wages and salaries are underreported, the estimated misreporting rate of self-employment business income is substantial. This paper studies how tax evasion in the self-employment sector affects aggregate outcomes and inequality. To this end, we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model with incomplete markets in which heterogeneous agents choose between being a worker and being self-employed. Self-employed agents may hide a share of their business income but are confronted with the probability of being detected by the tax authority. Our model replicates important quantitative features of U.S. data, in particular, the misreporting rate, wealth inequality, and the firm size distribution. Our quantitative findings suggest that tax evasion induces self-employed businesses to stay small. In the aggregate, tax evasion increases the size but decreases the productivity of the self-employment sector. Moreover, it increases aggregate savings and reduces wealth inequality. We show that tax revenues follow a Laffer curve in the size of the tax evasion penalty. JEL Classifications: H24, H25, H26, C63, E62, E65.",

		"abstract": "Motivated by the observation that access to evasion opportunities is distributed heterogeneously across the labor market, this paper examines the extent to which labor supply elasticities with respect to tax rates depend on such evasion opportunities. We first discuss the channels through which access to evasion affects labor supply responses and then set up a laboratory experiment (N=205) in which all participants undertake a real-effort task over several rounds. Subjects face a tax rate that varies across rounds and are required to pay taxes on earned income. The treatment group is given the opportunity to underreport income, while the control group is not. We find evidence that participants in the treatment group respond differently to changes in the net-of-tax rate than participants in the control group. The effect is more prevalent when tax rates fall. Additionally, the direction of the treatment effect is dependent on the evolution of tax rates across rounds. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

We investigate how tax rates, and the interaction between corruption and tax rates, influence variations in entry across a panel of 72 countries in the period 2005–2011. We use a series of panel estimations as well as several robustness checks to test these effects, using relevant controls for economic development, the size of the state, and other regulatory and tax policy measures. We find that higher tax rates consistently discourage entry. Further, we find that although the direct influence of corruption on entry is also consistently negative, the interaction influence of corruption and tax rate is positive. This indicates that corruption can offset the negative influence of high taxes on entry. We discuss the implications of our findings for policymakers and future research.",

We offer aformal model of corporate income tax evasion. While individual tax evasion is essentially a portfolio-selection problem, corporate income tax evasion is much more complicated. When the owner of a firm decides to evade taxes, not only does she risk being detected by the tax authorities, more importantly, the optimal compensation scheme offered to the employees will also be altered. Specifically, due to the illegal nature of tax evasion, the contract offered to the manager is necessarily incomplete. This creates a distortion in the manager's effort and reduces the efficiency of the contract. Tax evasion thus increases the profit retained by the firm not only at the risk of being detected, but also at the cost of efficiency loss in internal control.",

It reviews the comparative statics of the original model of individual behavior where the tax evasion decision is analogous to portfolio choice, and its extensions to incorporate socially conscious behavior, participation in the black labor market and tax evasion by firms. It also discusses the analysis of tax incidence and the problems involved in moving from individual to aggregate analysis. Finally, it reviews the issues that arise in formulating models of optimal taxation in the presence of tax evasion.",

		"abstract": "Tax avoidance and evasion are pervasive in all countries, and tax structures are undoubtedly skewed by this reality. Standard models of taxation and their conclusions must reflect these realities. This paper first presents theoretical models that integrate avoidance and evasion into the overall decision problem faced by individuals. Early models of this area focused on tax evasion, modeled as a gamble against the enforcement capability of the state. More recently, the literature has examined more general models of the technology of avoidance, with the additional risk bearing caused by tax evasion either being a special case of this technology or one aspect of the cost of changing behavior to reduce tax liability. If the cost of evasion and avoidance depends on other aspects of behavior, the choice of consumption basket and avoidance become intertwined. The paper then relates the behavior predicted by the model to what is known empirically about the extent of evasion and avoidance, and how it responds to tax enforcement policy. The paper then turns to normative analysis, and discusses how avoidance and evasion affect the analysis of vertical and horizontal equity as well as efficiency costs; a taxonomy of efficiency costs is presented. Acknowledging the variety of behavioral responses to taxation changes the answers to traditional subjects of inquiry, such as incidence, optimal progressivity, and the optimal mix between income and consumption taxes. It also raises a whole new set of policy questions, such as the appropriate level of resources to devote to administration and enforcement, and how those resources should be deployed. Because there are a variety of policy instruments that can affect the magnitude and nature of avoidance and evasion response, the elasticity of behavioral response is itself a policy instrument, to be chosen optimally. The paper reviews that is known about these issues, and introduces a general theory of optimal tax systems, in which tax rates and bases are chosen simultaneously with the administrative and enforcement regimes. We argue that the concept of the marginal efficiency cost of funds is a useful way to summarize the normative issues that arise, and expand the concept to include administrative costs, avoidance, and evasion. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Earlier work has examined the determinants of the size of the informal sector, focusing separately on factors such as tax and regulation burden, financial market development, and the quality of the legal system. We revisit this issue by using an integrated data set which contains information on all these aspects. Building on a simple analytical framework, we test the channels affecting the degree of informality. We find that the quality of the legal framework is crucially important in determining the size of the informal sector, whereas the significance of taxes, regulations, and financial constraints is reduced in the context of a well functioning legal system, consistent with the presented model. Additionally, firm size is negatively correlated with the propensity to go informal; finance constraints tend to induce informality among smaller firms but not among large firms, whereas legal obstacles induce informality among larger firms. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We find that e-invoicing increases reported firm sales, purchases and VAT liabilities by over 5 percent in the first year after adoption. The impact is concentrated among small firms and sectors with higher rates of non-compliance, suggesting that e-invoicing enhances compliance by lowering compliance costs and strengthening deterrence. However, we also find that existing stocks of VAT credits were used to offset the reform's positive effects on VAT collection, suggesting that digital tools such as e-invoicing would need to be complemented by other reforms to improve revenue mobilization.",

		"abstract": "I present a simple, unified approach to study the tax evasion practices often observed in developing countries. I develop a general equilibrium model where heterogeneous establishments optimally select themselves into informality, tax compliance, and formal tax evasion. Informal firms evade taxes by staying small, while larger, formal firms can engage in costly tax evasion. In equilibrium, tax revenues rely on medium-sized firms, which are scarce. In a calibration exercise using data from Mexico, I find that reducing the returns to tax evasion by formal firms increases tax revenues by up to 68%. However, economies where such returns are too high face a trade-off between tax collection and aggregate efficiency, as cracking down on formal tax-evading firms pushes some firms into informality. Last, as the economy develops, the informal sector shrinks, while the tax-evading sector expands, thus limiting potential collection. If lower informality is a byproduct of development, and not vice versa, a solid tax base can be achieved by fiscal authorities effectively by focusing on formal tax evasion.",

We consider three aspects of this question: the interpolation technique used, the inclusion of air quality as a continuous vs discrete variable in the model, and the estimation method. Using a sample of 115,732 individual house sales for 1999 in the South Coast Air Quality Management District of Southern California, we compare Thiessen polygons, inverse distance weighting, Kriging and splines to carry out spatial interpolation of point measures of ozone obtained at 27 air quality monitoring stations to the locations of the houses. We take a spatial econometric perspective and employ both maximum-likelihood and general method of moments techniques in the estimation of the hedonic. A high degree of residual spatial autocorrelation warrants the inclusion of a spatially lagged dependent variable in the regression model. We find significant differences across interpolators in the coefficients of ozone, as well as in the estimates of willingness to pay. Overall, the Kriging technique provides the best results in terms of estimates (signs), model fit and interpretation. There is some indication that the use of a categorical measure for ozone is superior to a continuous one. © 2006 Regional Studies Association.",

Over the past three decades, the Mexican economy has gone through a structural change and experienced a successful insertion into global markets. Yet productivity growth has been modest, leading to low and volatile economic growth. To examine the weak association between structural change and productivity growth, two features are studiedinter- and intra-industry transformations, and the contribution of production factors to value added growth. The paper shows that despite a significant reallocation of hours worked across industries, its aggregate impact has been hindered by the prevalence of flows from sectors with high labor productivity growth towards those with lower or declining productivity growth. In addition, highly qualified production factors (both labor and capital) have not showed a significant contribution to value added growth.",

Abstract: This paper applies a structural framework to estimate production function coefficients, obtain firm-level markup estimates, and evaluate the impact of the trade liberalization that took place in Mexico in the period 1984-1990 on the profitability of the firms operating in the domestic market and exporters. Quantitatively, the results show no evidence of substantial productivity growth, but some evidence of trade discipline on the price-cost margins. A markup premium is however identified for intensive exporters. Qualitatively, these results suggest that the effectiveness of trade policies crucially depends on adequately implementing complementary reforms aimed at improving the competitiveness and the efficiency in the allocation of resources in the internal market. Resumen: En este documento, se aplica un marco estructural para estimar los coeficientes de la función de producción, se obtienen estimaciones de márgenes precio-costo (markups) a nivel empresa y se evalúa el impacto de la liberalización comercial que ocurrió en México en el periodo 1984-1990 sobre la rentabilidad de las empresas que operan en el mercado nacional y la de los exportadores. Cuantitativamente, los resultados no muestran evidencia de un crecimiento sustancial de la productividad, pero sí cierta evidencia de la presencia de disciplina comercial en los márgenes de rentabilidad. Sin embargo, se observa una prima sobre los markups para los exportadores intensivos. Cualitativamente, estos resultados sugieren que la efectividad de las políticas comerciales depende fundamentalmente de la implementación adecuada de reformas complementarias que mejoren la competencia y la eficiencia en la asignación de los recursos en el mercado interno.

Abstract: This paper uses firm-level data for Mexican exporters to understand how firm-level export decisions shape a country's aggregate exports. The data allows for a characterization of both the cross-sectional distribution of Mexican exports, across destinations and across exporting firms, and of the time-series variation in aggregate exports and its relation to time-series variation in the export supply decisions of firms. It is found that the cross-sectional variation of exports is mostly accounted for the extensive margins of trade, particularly the extensive margin of number of products exported, while the time-series variation in aggregate exports is mostly accounted for by the intensive margin of trade, and in particular by the growth of exporting firms that retain their export status from year to year. Resumen: Este documento utiliza datos a nivel empresa de exportadores mexicanos para entender cómo las decisiones de exportación de las empresas determinan las exportaciones agregadas del país. Los datos permiten una caracterización de tanto la distribución transversal de las exportaciones mexicanas, a través de destinos y a través de empresas exportadores, así como de la variación en el tiempo de las exportaciones agregadas y su relación con la variación en el tiempo de las decisiones de exportación de las empresas. Se encuentra que la variación transversal en las exportaciones se explica principalmente por el margen extensivo del comercio, en particular por el margen extensivo del número de productos exportados, mientras que la variación en el tiempo de las exportaciones agregadas se explica principalmente por el margen intensivo del comercio, en particular por el crecimiento de aquellas empresas que mantienen su estatus exportador año tras año. Palabras Clave: Comercio internacional, empresas heterogéneas, productividad, empresas multi-producto, dinámica de exportadores. for helpful comments at various stages of this project.

Relying on plant-level data, we first decompose productivity and productivity growth into plant-level growth and market allocation forces. While the average productivity of the survivors is higher than the overall contribution of reallocation forces, during recessions the inverse is true and reallocation gives a positive, albeit small, contribution to aggregate productivity growth. Next we analyze how policy measures can determine allocative efficiency levels and growth, and find important scope for action on education, financial regulation, and structural reforms.",

The paper makes two contributions. First, we validate the approach of measuring misallocation indirectly (Hsieh and Klenow, 2009) by illustrating a close correlation between misallocation and per capita incomes across Mexican states. Second, we exploit the large variation in resource misallocation within industries and across states together with unusually rich data at the firm, local, and industry level to shed light on its determinants. We identify several well-defined distortions that have a statistically and economically meaningful effect on productivity via resource misallocation.",

We use the analytical framework proposed by Aghion et al. (2005) and evaluate their central hypothesis. We use firm-level data from the Mexican manufacturing survey over the period 2009–2017. Our results show a negative linear relationship between competition and the intensity of firm innovation investment. These results are primarily due to the substantial technological disparity that exists across firms within sectors, where most firms compete very far from the leaders.",

		"abstract": "We evaluate the relative importance of labor productivity versus income taxes and social contributions for tax compliance in an economy with a large degree of informality. Empirical evidence points out that tax evasion in Europe happens through partially concealing wages and profits in formally registered enterprises. To this end, we build a model in which employer-employee pairs of heterogeneous productive capacities make joint decisions on the degree of tax evasion. The quantitative model takes as inputs the income tax structure and social contributions. The model is used to analyze the case of Bulgaria which has the largest informal economy in Europe. The estimation strategy relies on matching the empirical series for the size of the informal economy and other aggregate outcomes for 2000-2014. Our counterfactual experiments show that the most important factor for the changing size of the informal economy is labor productivity, which accounts for more than 75% of the change. The variation in corporate income tax accounts for the rest. Changes in personal income tax levels and progressivity are found not to be quantitatively relevant for tax evasion. We also characterize optimal taxation in 2014 with respect to minimizing tax evasion. The productive gains of imposing optimal taxes are small. JEL Classifications: H24, H25, H26, C63, E62, E65.",

We find that firms which participate in these institutions exhibit significantly higher profits. Moreover, firms that borrow from formal or informal sources and those that pay taxes are significantly more likely to stay in business but firms that received credit exhibit lower rates of income growth. These results persist when firm characteristics that are arguably correlated with unobserved entrepreneurial ability are controlled for. Our findings suggest that the significant within-country differences in firm productivity observed in developing economies are due in part to market and government failures that limit the ability of micro-firms to reach their optimal sizes. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",

Using recently developed results in conjunction with reasonable assumptions about the exogeneity of the lights data generating process, we identify and estimate the relationship between nighttime light growth and GDP growth, as well as the nonparametric distribution of errors in both measures. We obtain three key results: (i) the elasticity of nighttime lights to GDP is about 1.3; (ii) national accounts GDP growth measures are less precise for low and middle income countries, and nighttime lights can play a big role in improving such measures; and (iii) our new measure of GDP growth, based on the optimal combination of nighttime lights and national accounts data under our identification assumptions, implies that China and India had considerably lower growth rates than official data suggested between 1993 and 2013. We expect our statistical framework and methodology to have a broad impact on measuring GDP using additional information.",

It first discusses what methodologies and data have facilitated these contributions, and then presents critical summaries of what has been learned. It discusses a promising new development-the analysis of randomized controlled trials mostly delivered via letters from the tax authority-and then reviews recent research using various methods about the impact of the principal enforcement tax policy instruments: audits, information reporting, and remittance regimes. I also explore several understudied issues worthy of more research attention. The paper closes by outlining a normative framework based on the behavioral response elasticities now being credibly estimated that allow one to assess whether a given enforcement intervention is worth doing.",

We provide a unique window into this global phenomenon using transaction-level tax data from Ecuador. Ghost transactions are widespread, prevalent among large firms and firms with high-income owners, and exhibit suspicious patterns in comparison to ordinary transactions: bunching at round numbers, at the end of the fiscal year, and just below financial system thresholds. We go on to study an innovative enforcement intervention that targeted ghost clients rather than ghosts themselves, which led to substantial tax recovery.",

Taxpayers in our model initially have low income and stochastically transit to high income that is an absorbing state. A low-income taxpayer who transits to high income can underreport his true income and evade his taxes. With a constant absolute risk-aversion utility function and a costly and imperfect auditing technology, we show that the optimal auditing mechanism in our model consists of cycles. Within each cycle, a low-income taxpayer is initially unaudited, but if the duration of low-income reports exceeds a threshold, then the auditing probability becomes positive. That is, the tax authority guarantees that the taxpayer is not audited until the threshold duration is reached. We also find that auditing becomes less frequent if the auditing cost is higher or if the variance of income is lower. © 2012 B. Ravikumar and Yuzhe Zhang.",

We compare an alternative audit policy to the standard random audit policy. We focus on an 'audit cutoff' policy, in which an agent triggers an audit if reported income is 'too low', and is not audited if reported income is 'sufficiently high'. We find that random audit rules are weakly dominated by audit cutoff rules. Given lump-sum taxes and fines, audit cutoff rules are the least-cost policies which induce truthful reporting of income. © 1985.",

A central question concerns the extent to which revenue should be raised through higher tax rates, which distort behavior, or greater enforcement, which distorts behavior and also entails direct resource costs. In the models examined, some expenditure on enforcement may be optimal despite its resource cost, its distortionary effect, and the availability of other revenue sources having no enforcement costs. Rules for optimal tax rates and enforcement expenditures are derived, which also indicate the marginal cost of government funds and optimal enforcement priorities for a tax collection agency. © 1990.",

We quantify the effects of tax rates on tax evasion by examining the relationship in China between the tariff schedule and the \"evasion gap,\" which we define as the difference between Hong Kong's reported exports to China at the product level and China's reported imports from Hong Kong. Our results imply that a one-percentage-point increase in the tax rate is associated with a 3 percent increase in evasion. Furthermore, the evasion gap is negatively correlated with tax rates on closely related products, suggesting that evasion takes place partly through misclassification of imports from higher-taxed categories to lower-taxed ones, in addition to underreporting the value of imports. © 2004 by The University of Chicago.

		"abstract": "Empirical research about tax evasion and the informal economy has exploded in the past few decades, seeking to shed light on the magnitude and (especially policy) determinants of these phenomena. Quantitative information informs the analysis of policy choices, enables the testing of hypotheses about determinants of this phenomenon, and can help with the accurate construction of national income accounts. Even as empirical analysis has burgeoned, some have expressed doubts about the quality and usefulness of some prominent measures. The fact that high-quality data is elusive is neither surprising nor a coincidence. The defining characteristic of tax evasion and informal economic activity-that they are generally illegal-often renders unreliable standard data collection methods such as surveys. Unlike invisible phenomena in the natural sciences, these invisible social science phenomena are hard to measure because of choices made by individuals. Analysis of tax evasion and the informal economy must proceed even in the absence of the direct observability of key variables, and theory should guide the construction and interpretation of evidence of the \"invisible.\" In this paper, we address what can be learned using micro or macro data regarding tax evasion and the informal economy under given conditions and assumptions, and critically review some of the most common empirical methods in light of our conclusions. We conclude with an entreaty for researchers in this field to enlist in the \"credibility revolution\" (Angrist and Pischke in J. Econ.

		"abstract": "This paper studies the trends and cycles of informal employment. It first presents a theoretical model where the size of informal employment is determined by the relative costs and benefits of informality and the distribution of workers' skills. In the long run, informal employment varies with the trends in these variables, and in the short run it reacts to accommodate transient shocks and to close the gap that separates it from its trend level. The paper then uses an error-correction framework to examine empirically informality's long-and short-run relationships. For this purpose, it uses country-level data at annual frequency for a sample of developed and developing countries, with the share of self-employment in the labor force as the proxy for informal employment. The paper finds that, in the long run, informality is larger in countries that have lower GDP per capita and impose more costs to formal firms, in the form of more rigid business regulations, less valuable police and judicial services, and weaker monitoring of informality. In the short run, informal employment is found to be counter-cyclical for the majority of countries, with the degree of counter-cyclicality being lower in countries with larger informal employment and better police and judicial services. Moreover, informal employment follows a stable, trend-reverting process. These results are robust to changes in the sample and to the influence of outliers, even when only developing countries are considered in the analysis.",

		"abstract": "In developing countries, informal firms account for up to half of economic activity. They provide livelihood for billions of people. Yet their role in economic development remains controversial with some viewing informality as pent-up potential and others viewing informality as a parasitic organizational form that hinders economic growth. In this paper, we assess these perspectives. We argue that the evidence is most consistent with dual models, in which informality arises out of poverty and the informal and formal sectors are very different. It seems that informal firms have low productivity and produce low- quality products; and, consequently, they do not pose a threat to the formal firms. Economic growth comes from the formal sector, that is, from firms run by educated entrepreneurs and exhibiting much higher levels of productivity. The expansion of the formal sector leads to the decline of the informal sector in relative and eventually absolute terms. A few informal firms convert to formality, but more generally they disappear because they cannot compete with the much more-productive formal firms.",

First, clustering algorithms like SOM and neural gas are used to identify groups of similar behaviour in the universe of taxpayers. Then decision trees, neural networks and Bayesian networks are used to identify those variables that are related to conduct of fraud and/or no fraud, detect patterns of associated behaviour and establishing to what extent cases of fraud and/or no fraud can be detected with the available information. This will help identify patterns of fraud and generate knowledge that can be used in the audit work performed by the Tax Administration of Chile (in Spanish Servicio de Impuestos Internos (SII)) to detect this type of tax crime.",

		"abstract": "Profit shifting by multinational corporations is thought to reduce tax revenue around the world. We analyze the introduction of standard regulations aimed at limiting profit shifting. Using administrative tax and customs data from Chile in difference-indifferences event-study designs, we find that the reform was ineffective in reducing multinationals' transfers to lower-tax countries and did not significantly raise tax payments. At the same time, interviews with tax advisors reveal a drastic increase in tax advisory services. The qualitative interviews also allow us to identify and then quantitatively confirm a common tax planning strategy in response to the reform. These results illustrate that when enforcement can be circumvented by sophisticated tax planning, it can benefit tax consultants at the expense of tax authorities and taxpayers.",

		"abstract": "Kotlarski's identity has been widely used in applied economic research based on repeated-measurement or panel models with latent variables. However, how to conduct inference for these models has been an open question for two decades. This paper addresses this open problem by constructing a novel confidence band for the density function of a latent variable in repeated measurement error model. The confidence band builds on our finding that we can rewrite Kotlarski's identity as a system of linear moment restrictions. Our approach is robust in that we do not require the completeness. The confidence band controls the asymptotic size uniformly over a class of data generating processes, and it is consistent against all fixed alternatives. Simulation studies support our theoretical results.",

		"abstract": "This paper formulates and estimates multistage production functions for children's cognitive and noncognitive skills. Skills are determined by parental environments and investments at different stages of childhood. We estimate the elasticity of substitution between investments in one period and stocks of skills in that period to assess the benefits of early investment in children compared to later remediation. We establish nonparametric identification of a general class of production technologies based on nonlinear factor models with endogenous inputs. A by-product of our approach is a framework for evaluating childhood and schooling interventions that does not rely on arbitrarily scaled test scores as outputs and recognizes the differential effects of the same bundle of skills in different tasks. Using the estimated technology, we determine optimal targeting of interventions to children with different parental and personal birth endowments. Substitutability decreases in later stages of the life cycle in the production of cognitive skills. It is roughly constant across stages of the life cycle in the production of noncognitive skills. This finding has important implications for the design of policies that target the disadvantaged. For most configurations of disadvantage it is optimal to invest relatively more in the early stages of childhood than in later stages.",

First, we demonstrate a general under-identification problem using these assumptions in a simple version of the Blundell-Bond dynamic panel model. In particular, the basic moment conditions can yield multiple discrete solutions: one at the persistence parameter in the main equation and another at the persistence parameter governing the regressor. Second, we propose possible solutions based on sign restrictions and augmented moments. We show the identification of our approach and propose a consistent estimation procedure. Our Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the under-identification issue and finite sample performance of our proposed estimator. Lastly, we show that the problem persists in many alternative models of the regressor but disappears in some models under stronger assumptions.",

We illustrate how timing and …rm information set assumptions are key to both methodologies, and how these assumptions can be strengthened or weakened almost continously. We also discuss other assumptions that have utilized in these literatures to increase the precision of estimates. Empirically, we then examine how, in a number of plant level production datasets, strengthening or weakening the timing/information set assumptions a¤ects the precision of estimates. We compare these impacts on precision to those achieved by imposing other potential assumptions.

Technological change and deregulation have caused a major restructuring of the telecommunications equipment industry over the last two decades. Our empirical focus is on estimating the parameters of a production function for the equipment industry, and then using those estimates to analyze the evolution of plant-level productivity. The restructuring involved significant entry and exit and large changes in the sizes of incumbents. Firms' choices on whether to liquidate, and on input quantities should they continue, depended on their productivity. This generates a selection and a simultaneity problem when estimating production functions. Our theoretical focus is on providing an estimation algorithm which takes explicit account of these issues. We find that our algorithm produces markedly different and more plausible estimates of production function coefficients than do traditional estimation procedures. Using our estimates we find increases in the rate of aggregate productivity growth after deregulation. Since we have plant-level data we can introduce indices which delve deeper into how this productivity growth occurred. These indices indicate that productivity increases were primarily a result of a reallocation of capital towards more productive establishments.",
