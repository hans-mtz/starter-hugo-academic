## Introduction 

Hans Martinez, Evan Sauve, and Tyler Skura started the Brown Bag Student Seminar at the Economics Department of Western University during the 2023 winter term. The seminar provides a forum for Ph.D. students of any year to present research in progress or research ideas in an informal and casual environment. Students receive feedback and suggestions to improve their work.

## Format and objectives

The seminar consists of short presentations 20-30 minutes long, followed by 10-15 min of questions and feedback. The meetings have place every Thursday from 12-1 p.m.
 
The seminar prioritizes providing content feedback on original work in progress or early research ideas and a safe environment to present new ideas and ask na√Øve questions.

## Additional info

Currently, the seminar is open to only Western students, but it is likely to be open to any Economics Ph.D. student shortly. To participate [contact me](mailto:<hmarti33@uwo.ca>). The current schedule is listed below.
